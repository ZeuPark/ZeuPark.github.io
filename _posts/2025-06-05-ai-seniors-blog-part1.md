## Why I studied this  

As I learned more about AI and web development, I realized that most AI tools are designed for tech-savvy users. I kept thinking about my parents and older relatives who could benefit from AI but feel intimidated by complex interfaces. I wanted to create something meaningful - not just another practice project, but a real product that could help bridge the digital divide and make AI accessible to seniors.

## What I did  

### Setting My Goals  

I decided to build an AI platform specifically designed for seniors (40s-60s+) with five clear objectives:  

#### 1. Make AI Accessible to Seniors  
My main goal was to let people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s easily experience, understand, and use AI without any technical barriers. I wanted them to feel confident, not confused.  

#### 2. Focus on Real AI Utility  
This would not be a game site or entertainment platform. I wanted to provide actual AI tools that could help seniors in their daily lives - things like text assistance, image recognition, or speech processing.  

#### 3. Super Simple Interface  
I aimed for a clean, minimal UI with few buttons and no clutter. I took inspiration from apps like Instagram or KakaoTalk that my older relatives actually use successfully.  

#### 4. Easy to Introduce in Community Settings  
I imagined this platform being used in senior centers, community hubs, or welfare facilities - almost like an AI experience booth where staff could easily demonstrate AI to visitors.  

#### 5. Build a Portfolio-Worthy Product  
This wasn't just practice - I wanted to create something worth showcasing as a socially impactful product that could make a real difference.  

### Understanding the Target Users  

I spent time thinking about what seniors really need from technology:  

#### Technical Limitations to Consider  
- Many seniors have low digital literacy  
- Small text and complex instructions are barriers  
- Multi-step processes can be overwhelming  
- Fear of "breaking something" or making mistakes  

#### Design Principles I Established  
- Large, clear buttons with simple labels  
- Minimal text using everyday language  
- One task per screen  
- Immediate, obvious feedback  
- No technical jargon  

### Researching AI Applications for Seniors  

I brainstormed which AI features would actually be useful:  

#### Potential AI Tools  
- Text summarization for long articles or documents  
- Voice-to-text for easier communication  
- Image description for accessibility  
- Simple photo editing or enhancement  
- Phishing or scam detection  
- AI-generated voice recognition for safety  

#### Questions I Had  
- Which of these would seniors actually use?  
- What problems do they face that AI could solve?  
- How do I avoid creating solutions for problems that don't exist?

## What I learned  

This planning phase taught me several important lessons:  

- **User research is crucial**: I realized I was making assumptions about what seniors need without actually talking to them  
- **Simple doesn't mean easy to build**: Creating a truly simple interface requires more thought, not less  
- **Social impact requires real understanding**: Building something meaningful means understanding the actual problems people face  
- **Technical constraints shape design**: I had to consider not just what's possible, but what's practical for the target environment  

The biggest insight was that I needed to balance my technical ambitions with real user needs. It's easy to get excited about AI capabilities, but much harder to figure out which ones actually improve people's lives.

## What I want to do next  

- Interview actual seniors about their technology needs and frustrations  
- Research existing studies on senior technology adoption  
- Create simple mockups to test basic interface concepts  
- Investigate which AI APIs are most reliable and cost-effective  
- Plan the technical architecture for easy deployment in community settings
