## What I Learned

### Inheritance
- Use `class Child(Parent)` to inherit functionality.
- Override or extend behavior with custom methods.

### Nested Functions
- Define one function inside another to isolate logic.
- Closures can remember outer variables.

### NumPy
- Fast array operations, slicing, shapes, and broadcasting.
- More powerful and efficient than Python lists.

### Error Handling
- Try-except blocks for catching and handling errors.
- `finally` and `raise` give more control.

## What I Thought About

I felt like I was finally coding “real stuff.” Inheritance showed me how OOP helps avoid duplication. With NumPy, I saw the value of vectorized operations for the first time. Nested functions made me rethink how I structure logic.

Error handling reminded me how easy it is to forget about edge cases — and how much better my programs feel when I handle them gracefully.

## What I Want to Do Next

- Use inheritance in a larger system like a game or a user system.
- Build a math or finance tool with NumPy arrays.
- Write functions that fail on purpose just to practice handling exceptions.
