excerpt: "This post documents my decision-making process between FAISS and Weaviate for implementing vector similarity search in a resource-constrained AI project."

## Background  

While working on an AI service project that involves vector similarity search, I had to choose between two widely used vector database options: **FAISS** and **Weaviate**. Both offer solid functionality, but their system requirements and architecture made me rethink what's feasible given my current development environment.  

This post outlines the technical and practical trade-offs I considered, the issues I encountered, and why I ultimately chose FAISS.

## Initial Considerations  

At first, Weaviate appeared to be a compelling option:  
- Built-in RESTful APIs  
- Modular plug-ins  
- Scalable architecture  
- Integration with OpenAI, Cohere, and others  

However, the Docker-based deployment of Weaviate introduced significant overhead. It consumed more RAM and CPU cycles than I could afford on my current machine setup, especially since I needed to reserve capacity for the model serving pipeline.  

I had discussed this with ChatGPT earlier and realized that while Weaviate provides many "convenient" features, they come with a price—namely, increased system complexity and resource usage. This wasn't ideal for a CPU-based prototype or tight resource constraints.

## Decision Pivot  

The conversation led me to reconsider FAISS. Its advantages:  
- Lightweight and fast  
- Offline index generation  
- Works well in CPU-only environments  
- High customizability with manual control  

Despite requiring more setup code and lacking built-in APIs, FAISS fit my immediate goal: **to get the core model serving reliably working on limited hardware**.  

My key realization was:  
> It doesn’t matter how fancy your vector DB is if your model can’t even run.

## Final Choice: FAISS  

After several test runs and comparisons:  
- **Weaviate**: Dockerized deployment worked but consumed too many resources.  
- **FAISS**: Simple Python integration, low memory usage, and fully manageable from my FastAPI backend.  

I was able to integrate FAISS with my retrieval pipeline, using MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings and a basic cosine similarity search via FAISS’ flat index. This was enough to build the first working prototype of my LLM service.  

---

## What I Learned  

- **Realistic constraints matter**. An architecture that works in theory may fail in practice if you don't have the infrastructure to support it.  
- **Simplicity scales better when you're learning**. FAISS forced me to understand how vector search works under the hood, and that knowledge is now reusable.  
- **Don't over-engineer too early**. Weaviate might be a better choice later, but not at the prototyping stage on a limited machine.

## Next Steps  

- Explore hybrid indexes in FAISS for better recall  
- Eventually try Weaviate again on a cloud GPU instance  
- Document performance benchmarks between FAISS and Weaviate in controlled conditions
