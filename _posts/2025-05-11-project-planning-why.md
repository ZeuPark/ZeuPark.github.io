excerpt: "A look into how asking 'why' guided my thinking while designing a data analysis project, before writing a single line of code."

## Introduction

Before I wrote any code or imported any libraries, I spent time planning a data analysis project — and most of that planning involved one simple thing: **asking 'why?' over and over**.

This post captures how I navigated through early-stage project design not with technical tools, but with intentional questions.

---

## The Problem

I wanted to explore how beginner developers struggle during their early learning process.

But... **why?**

→ Because I’ve been there myself — overwhelmed, lost, and stuck.  
→ Because bootcamps and instructors often don't understand where learners are actually struggling.  
→ Because I wanted to show empathy in data.

## My Idea

Use Reddit posts to extract emotional expressions and common obstacles that new coders face.

But again... **why Reddit?**

→ It’s raw. It’s real. It’s full of frustrated beginners sharing their genuine thoughts.  
→ The data isn’t curated or filtered like course feedback forms.  
→ Reddit threads reflect actual mental and emotional hurdles — not just technical blocks.

## Concerns That Came Up

**Q: Isn't that biased? Aren't Reddit posts just from people who are already struggling?**  
A: Yes — and that’s the point. This isn’t about average learners. It’s about those falling behind, crying out for help. They deserve visibility.

**Q: Can I measure anything from emotional language?**  
A: Not perfectly. But even qualitative signals — like frequency of frustration words or repeat complaints — can inform mentors and educators.

## Planning Themes

- **Empathy as a driver**: I wasn’t just curious. I cared. I wanted the project to speak up for silent strugglers.
- **Meaning over metrics**: I didn’t want to predict or classify. I wanted to understand.
- **Human-focused analysis**: The goal wasn’t model accuracy — it was insight into human learning pain points.

## What I learned

Planning like this taught me:
- A good project starts with a question, not with code
- “Why” leads to more powerful design than “how”
- Emotional clarity can make a technical project more impactful

---

## What I want to do next

- Start collecting data using Reddit API
- Learn basic text mining (tokenizing, word counts, filtering)
- Tag emotional keywords and categorize complaints
- Build a presentation or dashboard to share with educators or mentors

This post might not include any fancy code — but it reflects the **most important part of any project: the thinking that comes first**.
