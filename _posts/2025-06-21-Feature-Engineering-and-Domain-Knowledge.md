## Introduction

Whether I’m working on a Kaggle competition or my stock prediction project, one thing has become increasingly clear:

> Models are strong enough — it’s the **features** that matter most.

We now have a mature set of machine learning tools: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, ensemble stacking, even deep learning APIs. Most models today reach a baseline of solid performance if your data is clean.

## The Real Leverage: Feature Engineering

Here’s what I’ve learned through hands-on experiments:

- The same model with **different features** can give totally different results.
- A model with **too many noisy features** actually performs worse than one with fewer but relevant ones.
- The features I *assume* are important often turn out to be noise.

This is especially true in my stock project, where real-time volume, foreign trades, and price momentum all compete for attention.

## Feature ≠ Signal

Sometimes I include a feature because I believe it’s meaningful — but the model sees it as noise. That’s when I realized:

> **The model doesn’t care what I think. It cares what improves performance.**

So I started letting data drive decisions:
- Using permutation importance
- Testing SHAP values
- Iteratively pruning features that didn’t help

## Domain Knowledge is a Superpower

Still, good features don’t come from thin air. They come from understanding the problem deeply.

In stock prediction:
- If I want to predict price spikes, I must understand **what causes volatility**
- Is it earnings? Is it volume? Is it foreign investor behavior?

In Kaggle competitions:
- Top solutions often reflect **deep problem-specific insights**, not just clever code

That’s why I now spend more time learning **how the system works** before building any model.

## What I Learned

- Don’t rely solely on model complexity — it won’t fix poor features
- Trust the data over your intuition, but use intuition to guide data collection
- Strong domain knowledge leads to better feature creation, faster convergence, and more reliable models

---

## Takeaway

The secret to outperforming with machine learning is not in having the most complex model — it's in having **the most meaningful representation of the data**.

That means learning the domain, curating the data, and iteratively refining features until the model speaks the language of the problem.

## Next Steps

- Spend more time researching economic indicators in financial datasets
- Design new composite features for my stock volume ML project
- Apply this mindset more rigorously in future Kaggle competitions
