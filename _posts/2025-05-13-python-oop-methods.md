## What I Learned

### Class Methods
- `@classmethod` uses `cls` to operate at the class level.
- Good for alternative constructors and factory patterns.

### Static Methods
- `@staticmethod` doesn’t take `self` or `cls`.
- Best for utility functions that belong with a class, but don’t need instance data.

### Decorators
- A decorator wraps another function.
- I used `*args` and `**kwargs` to make them flexible and reusable.

## What I Thought About

I realized how these tools help keep class code clean and focused. Instead of adding random helper functions outside the class, I can now organize them inside with clear roles.

Decorators were tricky at first, but once I understood that functions are objects in Python, it clicked. It made me think of all the places I’m repeating checks or logging — and how decorators could simplify that.

## What I Want to Do Next

- Use classmethods to manage object creation with data loading.
- Add decorators to log or validate user input in CLI apps.
- Compare decorator functions with middleware-style ideas in web frameworks.
