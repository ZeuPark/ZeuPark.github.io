excerpt: "I started a personal project with a big idea: 'Why is machine learning hard for beginners?' But I quickly hit domain, technical, and time-related limitations that forced me to stop and reflect. This is that reflection."

## Introduction

I set out to explore an ambitious project:  
**“Why is machine learning so hard for beginners?”**

It felt important. It was personal. It was big.  
But as I tried to plan it, I realized I had made a critical mistake — I jumped into a complex, research-heavy topic without having the technical foundation, tools, or time to handle it. Here’s an honest reflection on why I’m putting it on pause and what I’ve learned.

## Domain Limitations

The core issue was that I chose a domain I couldn’t yet understand deeply.

> I was asking, “Why is ML hard?” before I had truly experienced machine learning myself.

I lacked hands-on experience with:
- Building even a basic model
- Understanding real learning pain points in context
- Working with real ML datasets

Even industry professionals tackle these questions after years of practice, and they usually rely on structured collaboration with experts and data engineers. I didn’t yet have those support systems — and it showed.

## Technical Limitations

There were too many things I didn’t yet know:
- How to **crawl** or collect meaningful data
- How to **clean**, reshape, or verify it using tools like pandas or NumPy
- How to decide if a dataset is even **usable** or **relevant**

I’m still learning the basics of:
- Python data handling
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data transformation techniques
- Evaluation of dataset quality

I simply wasn’t ready to make technical decisions about a domain-heavy project.

## Time Limitations

This project wasn’t my full-time job — I’m learning Python, SQL, and ML as part of ongoing classes.  
Trying to juggle all that **while designing a research-grade project in my free time** was unrealistic.

Even just trying to understand the domain meant reading books like:
- *Python for Machine Learning & Pandas*
- *Web Scraping with Python*
- *Dacon Competition Winning Solutions*
- *Introduction to Machine Learning with Python*

But reading is slow, and deep research requires focus. I didn’t have enough time to do it all well.

## Reflection

This was a humbling experience.

> I tried to do something beyond my current ability — and that’s okay.

The project was:
- Too large in scope
- Too technical for my current level
- Too time-intensive to balance with other commitments

But I learned more about **project selection**, **self-assessment**, and **setting achievable goals** than I ever could have by pretending it was going fine.

## What I’ll Do Next

- Refocus on **Kaggle community competitions** to observe and learn real workflows
- Pick topics I’m already familiar with to **narrow the domain**
- Start small, with structured problems I can realistically solve
- Write new project proposals based on my actual skills
- Continue reading and solving problems to widen my technical comfort zone

## Final Thought

Ambition is good. But so is realism.

This project was never a failure — it was a checkpoint.  
And now, I’m ready to move forward more grounded, more honest, and more prepared.
