## Introduction

Sometimes in coding, what you learn technically is only part of the story. This week I worked on two topics — **regular expressions** and **Python virtual environments**. On the surface, they had nothing in common. But as I worked through them, they both taught me something deeper: how to manage complexity and think clearly.

---

## The Problem

I wanted to:
- Extract patterns like phone numbers and zip codes using regular expressions
- Learn how to safely isolate Python projects using virtual environments

But honestly, I kept asking myself… **Why is this so tricky?**

→ Because regex forces you to think like a parser, not a human.  
→ Because environment errors can break your code before it even runs.  
→ Because both demand **structure**, not shortcuts.

## My Approach

### Regular Expressions

Using practice files, I wrote patterns that:
- Matched phone numbers like `010-1234-5678`
- Validated 5-digit zip codes
- Used `re.match()`, `re.search()`, and `re.findall()` correctly

```python
import re
pattern = r"(010|02|031)-\d{4}-\d{4}"
text = "고객센터 번호는 010-1234-5678입니다."
match = re.findall(pattern, text)
```

I also tried reading through logs and detecting structured text with variations.

### Virtual Environments

I studied how to create isolated Python environments with:

```bash
conda create --name myenv1 python=3.8
```

From that I learned:
- Each project can (and should) have its own Python + packages
- Dependency version conflicts are real, especially in machine learning
- Isolation isn’t a “nice to have” — it’s **necessary** for clean development

---

## What I Learned

### From Regex
- How to think in precise, symbolic patterns
- The difference between finding *some* match and *the correct* match
- That reading and debugging regex is just as important as writing it

### From Virtual Environments
- Why global installs always lead to trouble
- How even one package version mismatch can cause hours of pain
- That environment management is a critical dev skill — not just setup

---

## What I Thought About

I expected to "just learn some syntax." But instead, I:
- Practiced deeper problem-solving through symbolic thinking
- Felt how real-world problems (like environment breaks) derail projects
- Understood that structure and control are part of being a serious developer

---

## What I Want to Do Next

- Build a regex-driven data cleaner to remove/mask sensitive text
- Automate log parsing using pattern recognition
- Apply virtual environments to all my future projects
- Try `venv`, `conda`, and `pipenv` and compare their use cases

---

In the end, both topics reminded me of something bigger:  
**Good programmers don’t just write code — they manage complexity.**
