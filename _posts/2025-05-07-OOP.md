## Introduction
Today, I tried to create a rock-paper-scissors game using object-oriented programming in Python — and I ran into more challenges than I expected. Here’s a breakdown of what I struggled with, what questions I asked, and why it was difficult for me as a beginner.

## Challenges that I Faced to Understand

### 1. How to Use `__init__` Properly in a Class

I created a `Player` class with attributes like `name`, `hand`, and `winrate`. I used an `__init__` method to initialize them, but I wasn’t sure exactly why I needed it or how it worked behind the scenes.

Why it was hard: I didn’t fully understand what `self` was doing, and why every class seemed to need `__init__`. Everything felt very abstract at this stage.
---

### 2. Getting Valid User Input

I wanted the player to only input 1, 2, or 3 for their hand (representing scissors, rock, and paper). I tried to use a `while` loop with `input()`, and check `isdigit()`, but I mistakenly wrapped it in `int(input())` first — which caused an error when a non-number was entered.

Why it was hard: I didn’t know which part was actually wrong — was it `input()`, `int()`, or `isdigit()`? The error messages were not beginner-friendly at all.
---
### 3. Choosing Between 0 and None

I originally initialized `self.hand` to 0, but then I was told to use `None` instead. That confused me — isn’t 0 also a valid value?

Why it was hard: I didn’t realize that 0 could be a meaningful game input, whereas `None` is better for showing that nothing has been selected yet. It took a while to understand this concept of "placeholder vs real value."
---
### 4. Understanding Inheritance

I created a `ComputerPlayer` class that inherits from `Player`, and added a `select_hand()` method using `random.randint(1, 3)` to simulate the computer’s move.

Why it was hard: I understood `inheritance` in theory, but in practice, I wasn’t sure when or how `select_hand()` should be called, or how the structure was supposed to work.

---
### 5. Where Should I Create Player Objects?

I imported the `Player` class into another file where I wanted to handle the game. But then I got confused: do I create `p1` and `cpu` there? Or should the `Game` class create them? Should they be passed in as parameters?

Why it was hard: I was stuck between thinking procedurally (just make things and run them) and object-oriented (design classes and relationships). I didn’t know where responsibilities should go.

---
### 6. Overall Class Design Was Overwhelming

Since I’m new to object-oriented programming, I kept asking myself, “Am I doing this the right way?” I often felt like I was blindly following examples without understanding the reason behind the structure.

Why it was hard: It wasn’t just writing code anymore — it was about designing relationships between pieces like `Player`, `ComputerPlayer`, and `Game`. That felt like something only professionals would know how to do.

## What I learned

Today, I learned how to make a simple rock-paper-scissors game using classes in Python. I found out how the `__init__`() function sets up things like a player’s name and hand, and why `self` is needed inside a class. I also learned that `None` is better than `0` when something hasn’t been chosen yet. For user input, I practiced using a `while` loop with `isdigit()` to make sure the player types a number. I tried class inheritance by making a `ComputerPlayer` from `Player` and giving it a random hand. Lastly, I learned that just importing a class isn’t enough—you also have to create the objects yourself, and knowing where to do that is important.

## What I want to do next

Next, I want to keep practicing so I can get more comfortable with this structure. I plan to do more small exercises using classes and then try building a simple project that uses objects properly. This will help me understand how to use what I learned in real situations.
