Today I studied **functions in Python**, including defining functions, using parameters and return values, and practicing with simple exercises.

---

## 🔍 What I Learned

- `def` keyword is used to define functions
- Parameters are placeholders for input
- `return` sends back output from the function
- Functions help organize and reuse code

## 💡 Example Code

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Zeu"))
