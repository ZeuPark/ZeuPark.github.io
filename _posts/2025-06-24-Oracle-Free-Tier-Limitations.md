excerpt: "Analyzing the practical issues of using Oracle Cloud Free Tier in Korea—especially the challenge of regional resource shortages that block new VM deployments."
---

## Background

Oracle Cloud Free Tier is attractive because it offers:
- **2× 4 vCPU, 24 GB RAM Arm-based (Ampere) VMs**
- **1 GB RAM AMD VM**
- **Autonomous Database** and other always‑free resources

For a zero‑budget developer, this is a lifeline for hosting backend servers, databases, or even small LLM inference endpoints.

## The Problem: Regional Resource Exhaustion

To ensure low latency in Korea, I need to deploy in **Seoul** or **Chuncheon** regions.  
However, Oracle enforces **regional quotas**. When local inventory of free‑tier resources is exhausted:

> You can’t launch a new instance—period.

Even if Ampere A1 is theoretically “always free,” it’s unavailable if your region has no capacity.

### Symptoms
- The console returns *“Out of capacity”* when creating an instance.
- The shape picker greys out A1.Flex or VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro.
- Support tickets aren’t accepted for free‑tier capacity issues.

## Workarounds Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Wait and retry** | No policy violation | Unpredictable | 
| **Switch to another region (e.g., Osaka, Tokyo)** | Often has capacity | Higher latency (∼200 ms) |
| **Create a new account** | Fresh quota | Risk of account suspension for “multi‑account abuse”; requires new credit card |
| **Use paid resources temporarily** | Guaranteed capacity | Defeats “free” goal |
| **Alternative free providers (e.g., Fly.io hobby tier, Render free web service)** | Quick to start | Lower CPU/RAM limits; no persistent block storage |

---

## Risk Analysis

Oracle’s terms prohibit circumventing quotas via multiple free accounts.  
If detected, **all related accounts can be terminated**. Losing an instance unexpectedly is worse than not having one.

---

## My Current Plan

1. **Monitor capacity daily** in Seoul/Chuncheon.  
2. If capacity remains zero for >1 week, deploy to **Osaka** and use Cloudflare to mitigate latency.  
3. Keep services **stateless** so I can migrate quickly when Korean capacity opens.  
4. Document deployment scripts with Terraform to make redeployment a 5‑minute task.

---

## Takeaways

- Free tiers come with hidden costs: **time and uncertainty**.
- A reliable deployment story often requires **paid fallback**.
- Until I can budget for a paid VM, I’ll architect my stack to survive sudden region switches.

---

## Next Steps

- Explore containerized deployment on Fly.io as an interim backup.
- Investigate cost of <10 USD/month VPS as a minimal paid safety net.
- Automate regional health checks and notify when Seoul/Chuncheon capacity returns.
