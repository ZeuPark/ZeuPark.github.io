excerpt: "Reflecting on whether relying on AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude for coding helps deepen understanding or hinders the development of true programming skills."

## Background

As I work on projects that span across **frontend, backend, and databases**, I’ve been leaning heavily on AI tools like:
- **ChatGPT**
- **Claude**
- **Cursor IDE**

These tools help me generate boilerplate code, fix bugs, and even build full components. But lately, I’ve been asking myself:

> Am I actually learning how to code — or just learning how to ask AI to code for me?

---

## The Dilemma

I can explain the **architecture** of my projects:
- Why I used FastAPI for backend
- Why I selected SQLite or PostgreSQL
- Why I used FAISS instead of Weaviate

I understand the **flow and logic**.  
But if you put me in front of a blank editor and said, *“write the code for this from scratch”* — I’d probably freeze.

That worries me.

## What I Gain from Using AI

- **Speed**: AI drastically reduces the time spent searching documentation
- **Exploration**: I can test multiple approaches quickly
- **Confidence**: It helps me attempt things I wouldn’t even try alone

---

## What I Risk Losing

- **Muscle memory**: Without repetition, I don’t retain syntax or patterns
- **Debugging depth**: I rely on the AI to fix things I don’t fully understand
- **Real fluency**: I’m not yet at the level to build the same solution *solo*

This is like learning a language through translation — I get the meaning, but I can't yet speak fluently.

---

## My Long-Term Goal

I don’t want to just copy-paste code and hope it works. I want to:
- **Understand the concepts deeply**
- **Explain every design choice** in my project
- **Be confident enough to reproduce parts manually**, even if AI is available

The goal isn’t to avoid AI. It’s to use AI as a **collaborator**, not a crutch.

---

## What I'm Doing About It

- I pause after generation to **review every line** and ask: “why is this here?”
- I write summaries in my own words to explain key components
- I try to re-implement small parts manually without AI
- I document all my design choices clearly in blog posts (like this one)

---

## Final Thought

Using AI isn’t cheating — it’s accelerating.  
But **if I don’t stop to understand**, I’m not growing.

I want to build systems I understand, not just run systems that work.

So I’ll keep using AI — but I’ll make sure I’m the one in control of the idea, the design, and eventually, the implementation.
