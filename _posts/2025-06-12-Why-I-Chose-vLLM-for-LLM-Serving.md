## Background

While designing a deployable LLM-based service, one critical question kept surfacing:

> How can I serve many users simultaneously, without sacrificing speed or resource efficiency?

Initially, my idea was simple: fine-tune a model and expose it via an API. However, I soon ran into performance bottlenecks. Traditional APIs, especially when not optimized for batch processing or token streaming, often failed to scale under multiple requests.

---

## What is vLLM?

**vLLM** is an optimized inference engine built specifically for large language models. Its core features include:
- **PagedAttention** for memory-efficient token handling
- **Continuous batching** to serve multiple requests concurrently
- Support for OpenAI-compatible APIs
- GPU-level acceleration with reduced latency

In short, vLLM allows LLMs to serve faster and at scale, which makes it ideal for production environments.

## Why I Needed vLLM

In my use case, I wasn't just generating answers — I was integrating:
- RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)
- User-facing prompts
- Multiple requests at once

This meant two things:
1. **Latency had to be low**, especially when retrieving and generating in tandem.
2. **Throughput needed to scale**, so I could serve concurrent users without queue delays.

vLLM addressed both with its efficient runtime and batching mechanism.

## My Deployment Strategy

Originally, I considered hosting my fine-tuned model and exposing it via external APIs. But this posed two major problems:
- I couldn't use vLLM effectively if the model wasn't local.
- API latency was unpredictable, depending on hosting provider and bandwidth.

So I pivoted to a **local serving strategy**, even if it meant aggressive model quantization and system tuning. This way, I could:
- Keep the model on the same server
- Run it directly via vLLM
- Handle multiple requests with better speed and reliability

---

## What I Learned

- **vLLM is built for scale**, not just for demos. In real-world use, it handles concurrent requests more gracefully than traditional inference pipelines.
- **You need local control** over the model to use vLLM effectively. This influenced my architecture to stay self-contained.
- **Optimization pays off**. Quantization and memory tuning made it feasible to serve on modest hardware.

## Example Command to Launch a vLLM Server

```bash
python3 -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server   --model ./my_model   --tokenizer ./my_model   --port 8000   --dtype float16   --max-model-len 2048
```

This launches a local OpenAI-compatible API using your fine-tuned model.

## Why This Matters for My Project

Using vLLM aligned perfectly with my project goals:
- Reduced latency in generation
- More consistent performance under load
- Flexibility to integrate with my own retrieval + prompt pipeline

Ultimately, it's not just about having a good model — it's about serving it well. And for that, vLLM was the right choice.

---

## Next Steps

- Integrate token streaming into frontend
- Load balance vLLM across multiple endpoints
- Experiment with model quantization techniques for even smaller memory footprint
